### Extra accounts to pull from DB in percentage of total workers for swap.
### Default 0.0 (0%)

#
### For example, if you want to have extra 10% accounts for periodic swapping, set
#EXTRA_ACCOUNT_PERCENT = 0.1

### Lv30 accounts to pull from DB in percentage of total workers for encounter.
### Setting this will enable Lv30 pool for encounters
### Default 0.0(0%)
#LV30_PERCENT_OF_WORKERS = 0.0
#
### For example, if you want to have 5% level 30 acccounts for encounter, set
#LV30_PERCENT_OF_WORKERS = 0.05
#
### Delay in seconds before starting next encounter.
### This allows adjustment of overall encounter rate (to make it slower).
#LV30_ENCOUNTER_WAIT=0.0

### Gym Raider accounts to pull from DB in percentage of total gyms inside the borders for gym scanning.
### Default 0.0(0%) Monkey Raiders turned off by default
#RAIDERS_PER_GYM = 0
#
### For example, if you want to have 0.03 raiders per gym, set 0.03.
### As a basic guideline, 0.03 would result in around 5 mins refresh time for all gyms.
### The following describes requirement of 3 workers per 100 gyms with guarantee of maximum 5 mins refresh time.
#RAIDERS_PER_GYM = 0.03

### Do GMO requests for lv30 accounts.
### Setting False will increase encounter rate and reduce hashing usage as it will apply insta-teleport encounter.
### Setting True will reduce account ban risks as it will apply normal Monocle behavior.
### Default False.
#LV30_GMO = False

### Maximum speed for lv30 accounts in SPEED_UNIT/hr.
### Defaults to 0.0 (disabled).
### When disabled, worker will not take any traveling time to encounter. (insta-teleport activated!)
#LV30_MAX_SPEED = 745.6454

### If encounter jobs queue up more than this amount, new sightings will be saved without encounter.
### Defaults to 0, which means no max limit.
#LV30_MAX_QUEUE = 0
#
###It is recommended to set it to this formula if you decided to cap the max queue size.

##### Referencing landmarks in your tweets/notifications

#### It is recommended to store the LANDMARKS object in a pickle to reduce startup
#### time if you are using queries. An example script for this is in:
#### scripts/pickle_landmarks.example.py
#from pickle import load
#with open('pickles/landmarks.pickle', 'rb') as f:
#    LANDMARKS = load(f)

### if you do pickle it, just load the pickle and omit everything below this point

#from monocle.landmarks import Landmarks
#LANDMARKS = Landmarks(query_suffix=AREA_NAME)

# Landmarks to reference when Pokémon are nearby
# If no points are specified then it will query OpenStreetMap for the coordinates
# If 1 point is provided then it will use those coordinates but not create a shape
# If 2 points are provided it will create a rectangle with its corners at those points
# If 3 or more points are provided it will create a polygon with vertices at each point
# You can specify the string to search for on OpenStreetMap with the query parameter
# If no query or points is provided it will query with the name of the landmark (and query_suffix)
# Optionally provide a set of hashtags to be used for tweets about this landmark
# Use is_area for neighborhoods, regions, etc.
# When selecting a landmark, non-areas will be chosen first if any are close enough
# the default phrase is 'in' for areas and 'at' for non-areas, but can be overriden for either.

### replace these with well-known places in your area

## since no points or query is provided, the names provided will be queried and suffixed with AREA_NAME
#LANDMARKS.add('Rice Eccles Stadium', shortname='Rice Eccles', hashtags={'Utes'})
#LANDMARKS.add('the Salt Lake Temple', shortname='the temple', hashtags={'TempleSquare'})

## provide two corner points to create a square for this area
#LANDMARKS.add('City Creek Center', points=((40.769210, -111.893901), (40.767231, -111.888275)), hashtags={'CityCreek'})

## provide a query that is different from the landmark name so that OpenStreetMap finds the correct one
#LANDMARKS.add('the State Capitol', shortname='the Capitol', query='Utah State Capitol Building')

### area examples ###
## query using name, override the default area phrase so that it says 'at (name)' instead of 'in'
#LANDMARKS.add('the University of Utah', shortname='the U of U', hashtags={'Utes'}, phrase='at', is_area=True)
## provide corner points to create a polygon of the area since OpenStreetMap does not have a shape for it
#LANDMARKS.add('Yalecrest', points=((40.750263, -111.836502), (40.750377, -111.851108), (40.751515, -111.853833), (40.741212, -111.853909), (40.741188, -111.836519)), is_area=True)

### PgScout (Credit to Avatar690)
## MUST MATCH YOUR PGSCOUT CONFIG.JSON.  Will encounter based on ENCOUNTER_IDs above.  
## If encounter fails, worker.py will attempt to encounter with the running acount (if lv > 30)
## If it fails, sighting will be saved without additional encounter info.

### Enter in your address for PGSCOUT hook endpoint including hostname, port (if any) and path.
### If set to a url, PGSCOUT will be used. If None, normal Monocle encounter will be used. 
#
#PGSCOUT_ENDPOINT = None
#
## Example,
#PGSCOUT_ENDPOINT = {"http://127.0.0.1:1234/iv","http://127.0.0.1:1235/iv"}
#
## *Take note that /iv is needed at the end for PGScout. Do not remove it.*

## Set the connection timeout to wait on a response from PGScout.  Default is 40 seconds.
## Timeout will be connection dependent, proxy dependent, etc.  I recommend keeping it at the default.
## Going too high will certainly guarantee a response from a Scout but will lead to greater inefficiency
## and instability for Monocle
#
#PGSCOUT_TIMEOUT = 40 
#


### Record keeping settings
###
### If True, new fort_sightings and raids will be inserted. Else, existing records for the same fort will be updated (if found).
### Default is False
#KEEP_GYM_HISTORY = False
#
### If True, new sightings inserted. Else, existing sighting for the same spawnpoint will be updated (if found).
### Default is True
#KEEP_SPAWNPOINT_HISTORY = True 


### Cleanup
## Max number of rows to delete in each execution per table. Not recommended to set it too high. It will choke the DB.
# CLEANUP_LIMIT = 100000

## Table specific cleanup times. Set -1.0 to disable
# CLEANUP_RAIDS_OLDER_THAN_X_HR = 6.0
# CLEANUP_SIGHTINGS_OLDER_THAN_X_HR = 6.0
# CLEANUP_FORT_SIGHTINGS_OLDER_THAN_X_HR = 6.0
